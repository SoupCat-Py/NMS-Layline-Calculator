# NMS-Layline-Finder
Use this calculator to find 3-star deposits (runaway mould, sac venom, and metal fingers) in No Man's Sky <br />
Made by Soup Cat and Bjorn the Void Trader <br />

This is a remake of a remake of a program that Bjorn made a while ago, now made using customtkinter for the UI. <br />
Included are all the files needed to run the program. <br />

To run the application on windows, simply download the zipped build folder and create a shortcut to 'NMSLC-v3.exe' <br />
Don't move any files.

Coming soon to mac (I hope)
