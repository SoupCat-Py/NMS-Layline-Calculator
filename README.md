# NMS-Layline-Calculator
Use this calculator to find 3-star deposits (runaway mould, sac venom, and metal fingers) in No Man's Sky <br />
Made by Soup Cat and Bjorn the Void Trader <br />

This is a remake of a remake of a program that Bjorn made a while ago, now made using customtkinter for the UI. <br />
Included are all the files needed to run the program if you have python installed and all the program's dependencies. <br />

Download the app for Windows or MacOS (intel) here -> https://github.com/SoupCat-Py/NMS-Layline-Calculator/releases <br />
Idk why but the "source code" download in the releases isn't including the new files and updates I made so isntead, download "source.zip" from the code tab if you want the source code. They're the same for mac and windows.

<h3>To Apple Users:</h3>
If you have an M-series (apple silicon) mac and you know what you're doing, I would greatly appreciate if you made a build for ARM architecture :)
