# NMS-Layline-Calculator

Use this calculator to find 3-star deposits (runaway mould, sac venom, and metal fingers) in No Man's Sky.  
Made by Soup Cat and Bjorn the Void Trader.

It is a remake of a remake of a program that Bjorn made a while ago, now made using CustomTkinter for the UI. Included are all the files used to make the program. Make sure to install any dependencies in order to run the `.py`.

## How to use NMS Layline Calculator

1. Go to [releases](https://github.com/SoupCat-Py/NMS-Layline-Calculator/releases) and download the `.zip` for the correct system <br />
![download one of the top two, depending on platform](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc6db309-5496-4514-a241-d9c272dafd04)

   - macOS zip file contains a `.app`
   - Windows zip file contains a `.zip`

2. Grant NMSLC permission to access your downloads. It only needs this to log your results
   
4. You are more than welcome to take a look at the source code if you have any doubts :)

NMSLC contains detailed instructions as well as useful info on 3-star resources and laylines under the "help" menu tab. However, if you prefer it in the form of a video, we have prepared a [short demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ec8QN39GNB8) (video link is also in the app's guide).
>*Install the included NMS font (found in the code tab) for the best experience*

## Message to Apple Users from Soup:

We do not currently have access to an Apple Silicon Mac, so if you have one and you know what you're doing, We would greatly appreciate it if you made a build natively for ARM architecture. <br />
Don't hesitate to [contact soup](https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&to=soupcat.py@gmail.com) if you think this is something that you can do. :)

**Note**: The "source code" download in the releases isn't always the most up-to-date, so instead, download `source.zip` from the code tab if you want the latest source code. They're the same for Mac and Windows.
