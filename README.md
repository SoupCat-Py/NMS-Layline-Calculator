# NMS-Layline-Calculator

Use this calculator to find 3-star deposits (runaway mould, sac venom, and metal fingers) in No Man's Sky.  
Made by Soup Cat and Bjorn the Void Trader.

This is a remake of a remake of a program that Bjorn made a while ago, now made using CustomTkinter for the UI. Included are all the files used to make the program. Make sure to install any dependencies in order to run the `.py`.

NMSLC contains detailed instructions as well as useful info on 3-star resources and laylines under the "help" menu tab. However, if you prefer it in the form of a video, we have prepared a [short demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ec8QN39GNB8).

## Message To Apple Users from Soup:

We do not currently have access to an Apple Silicon Mac, so if you have one and you know what you're doing, I would greatly appreciate it if you made a build for ARM architecture. :)

**Note**: The "source code" download in the releases isn't including the new files and updates I made, so instead, download `source.zip` from the code tab if you want the source code. They're the same for Mac and Windows.
