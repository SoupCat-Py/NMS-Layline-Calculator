# NMS-Layline-Finder
Use this calculator to find 3-star deposits (runaway mould, sac venom, and metal fingers) in No Man's Sky <br />
Made by Soup Cat and Bjorn the Void Trader <br />

This is a remake of a remake of a program that Bjorn made a while ago, now made using customtkinter for the UI. <br />
Included are all the files needed to run the program if you have python installed and all the program's dependencies. <br />

I have made a build for Windows but unfortunately do not know how to make one for MacOS :/ <br />
Sorry to all my friends on mac.

Coming soon to mac (I hope)
