<h3>Message To Apple Users from soup:</h3>
We do not currently have acces to an Apple Silicon mac, so if you have one and you know what you're doing, I would greatly appreciate if you made a build for ARM architecture :)
<h6>Idk why but the "source code" download in the releases isn't including the new files and updates I made so isntead, download "source.zip" from the code tab if you want the source code. They're the same for mac and windows. <h 6/>
