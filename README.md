# NMS-Layline-Calculator

Use this calculator to find 3-star deposits (runaway mould, sac venom, and metal fingers) in No Man's Sky.  
Made by Soup Cat and Bjorn the Void Trader.

It is a remake of a remake of a program that Bjorn made a while ago, now made using CustomTkinter for the UI. Included are all the files used to make the program. Make sure to install any dependencies in order to run the `.py`.

4. Run the program (varies by system):
   - **Windows**: Open the `.exe` and **do not** mess with the directory folder; we are working on packaging it into the `.exe`.
   - **MacOS**: Open the `.app` and follow the instructions from the release page.
5. Grant NMSLC permission to access your downloads. It only needs this to log your results
6. You are more than welcome to take a look at the source code if you have any doubts :)

NMSLC contains detailed instructions as well as useful info on 3-star resources and laylines under the "help" menu tab. However, if you prefer it in the form of a video, we have prepared a [short demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ec8QN39GNB8).

## Message to Apple Users from Soup:

We do not currently have access to an Apple Silicon Mac, so if you have one and you know what you're doing, I would greatly appreciate it if you made a build for ARM architecture. <br />
Don't hesitate to [reach out to me](https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&to=soupcat.py@gmail.com) if you think this is something that you can do. :)

**Note**: The "source code" download in the releases isn't including the new files and updates I made, so instead, download `source.zip` from the code tab if you want the source code. They're the same for Mac and Windows.
