# NMS-Layline-Calculator
Use this calculator to find 3-star deposits (runaway mould, sac venom, and metal fingers) in No Man's Sky <br />
Made by Soup Cat and Bjorn the Void Trader <br />

This is a remake of a remake of a program that Bjorn made a while ago, now made using customtkinter for the UI. <br />
Included are all the files needed to run the program if you have python installed and all the program's dependencies. <br />

<h3>How to use NMS Layline Calculator</h3> 
1. Open releases https://github.com/SoupCat-Py/NMS-Layline-Calculator/releases and download .exe for Windows or .zip for MacOS(Intel) depedning on your system <br />
2. Run .exe file or follow instructions for .zip  <br />
(In its current state .exe might be detected as "Program with unwanted behaviour" and subsecuently blocked by Windows Defender) <br />

<br>Program contains detailed instructions as well as usefull info on 3 star resources and Laylines under "Help" button. However if you prefer it in a form of a video we have a [short demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ec8QN39GNB8) <br />

<br>Idk why but the "source code" download in the releases isn't including the new files and updates I made so isntead, download "source.zip" from the code tab if you want the source code. They're the same for mac and windows. <br />

<h3>To Apple Users:</h3>
If you have an M-series (apple silicon) mac and you know what you're doing, I would greatly appreciate if you made a build for ARM architecture :)
