# NMS-Layline-Finder
Use this calculator to find 3-star deposits (runaway mould, sac venom, and metal fingers) in No Man's Sky <br />
Made by Soup Cat and Bjorn the Void Trader <br />

This is a remake of a remake of a program that Bjorn made a while ago, now made using customtkinter for the UI. <br />
Included are all the files needed to run the program. <br />

We're still working on making a build of the whole thing so you can run it as an EXE. <br />
For now though, you can run it if you have python installed, as well as customtkinter and pillow.
