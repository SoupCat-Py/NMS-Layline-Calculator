Laylines are lines of longitude (vertical lines that go from north to south)
that will spawn 3 star deposits. 

If you find a layline - either by yourself or by using this calculator -
all you have to do is to go straight North or South to find deposits. 

Laylines found using this calculator are valid between 45°N and 45°S.
That doesnt mean there will be no deposits. It means that laylines aren't
that certain outside of that range
